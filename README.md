## go-ahead

---

Basically, it's my test project where I can play around with new rails features and other technologies & frameworks but in the process I will try to make something useful at least for myself :D

As a tech stack I plan to use the latest ruby and rails versions + react 18, also I always wanted to try so-called utility-first approach so for the CSS framework I chose the Tailwind CSS. Also i wanted to get out of my life a Webpacker and try to use the importmaps, maybe i gonna regret this decision :D
